# star-bot
This bot will send you a DM copy of a message if you react to the message with an emoji. the default emoji is pushpin. You can change it by pinging the bot with a new emoji name, or "reset" to change it back to default.

note: at this time sending an actual emoji that is custom does not work. you need to type the plaintext name of the emoji.
